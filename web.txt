    The amount I've learned this week, is probably the most I've learned in a one week span, in a very long time.
Maybe even more than highschool. I have learned how when you look for a website, you download a copy from 
the websites server and that server has to interact with other things sometimes aswell to get it. The links we click on,
have so many parts such as the http. Hypertext transfer protocol and http secured is the main two ways on how the browser 
and server communicate, with the secured version being encrypted and better. The host name is the 'nickname' which the DNS
translates in the IP address. The part after .com,.gov, etc guides you to a specific part of the website server. If there is an error
code we can go to http.cat to see what that error code means, and there are ALOT! Companies like google, sometimes design the  
webpage for those errors, to look more professional I believe. With 200 being a success and 404 meaning not found and being
the most common.
    With CSS,HTML,and Javascript, I learned the most about how they are programmed togethor. I came in with a little understa-
nding on Javascript functions,arrays, and other basics from codecademy but I learned so much more this week about them this week. 
On css I learned about all the different styling options and how you can affect so many different aspects of your website. Learning
how to attach your HTML tags to your css seemed to be easier than I thought it be and I enjoyed it. I learned about the tags in HTML
and how there are so many. Assigning IDs and classes to tags to identify them on your css and Javascript. With Javascript, learning the
methods to identify tags on HTML and add functionality to buttons, pictures, etc using functions was brand new to me and took some getting
used to. Overall I still have a lot to learn and practice but this weeks lesson and assignments were alot of learning.
